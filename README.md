## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have **Node.js** and **npm** (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (or create a new React app):**
    If you're starting fresh, create a new React app:
    ```bash
    npx create-react-app github-repo-tracker
    cd github-repo-tracker
    ```
    If you're cloning an existing repo:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/github-repo-tracker.git](https://github.com/your-username/github-repo-tracker.git) # Replace with your repo URL
    cd github-repo-tracker
    ```

2.  **Install project dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install axios
    # Or simply: npm install (if you cloned and package.json exists)
    ```

3.  **Update `App.js` and `index.css`:**
    Replace the content of `src/App.js` and `src/index.css` with the latest code provided (from the last successful code generation).
